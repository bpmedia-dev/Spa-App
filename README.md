# Cryrotherapy App Idea
This app was built on twitch. See videos [here](#).

*!One week is missing due to a technical error*

## To Note
This entire app is made using Jetpack Compose. The whole idea was to get a bit more familiar with it by building a new app.

## Architecture Pattern
Using MVVM because that is the standard. ~There is also use of Hilt (if I did things right).~


## Other Notes
This use of Hilt isn't completely right. It works for this example but not what I suggest one use long term.

## Nice to haves
- appts in order with today on top
- click item from apts to cancel
- click on item from details to add to user appointments
- service screen & appointment screen use same column idea
- bottom nav goes away on detail
- service name in title bar

## Two versions
main branch: code from stream that hasn't been altered

cleanup branch: code from stream with logic clean up
